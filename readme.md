This repository is all about project euler (https://projecteuler.net/archives)
DO NOT copy and paste the code OR anything else that goes against what project euler stands for
I highly recommend trying it out YOURSELF and not just copying and pasting this code since the hole reason for project euler is to learn no skill
This code is ONLY FOR university admission to look at.
This repository will be made privat once university admission have seen this, but if that takes to lonb this repository will be made privat in March 2023

Hope you have a great day
N.L.
