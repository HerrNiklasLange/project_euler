This repository is all about project euler (https://projecteuler.net/archives)
I highly recommend trying it out yourself and not just copying and pasting this code since the hole reason for project euler is to learn no skill
Never the less you are free to look at my solutions and compare it with yours when you are done or want to quickly skim over if you are stuck (which happens everyone at some point).

Hope you have a great day
N.L.
